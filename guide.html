            <h2>Switching Sites</h2>
            <p>You will probably need to switch sites first before doing anything. This can be done by accessing the dropdown menu at the top left corner of Cascade. You will most likely be in "AGF Files" for most of your tasks.</p>

            <p>Sometimes you'll need to upload a file like a PDF or an image file to Cascade</p>
            <p>Navigate to the folder you are uploading the file or document to. There's probably a similar file in the folder, so copy it and click on "Edit". Edit anything you need to (title, summary, date, etc.) and keep in mind of the naming conventions from the other files in the folder. Drag the file that you're uploading to the bottom of the content tab where it says "Drop a file here". Hit submit, uncheck "use workflow", and publish the file.</p>

            <h2>Replacing Files</h2>
            <p>You may need to replace a PDF, image file, or other files in Cascade.</p>
            <p>Navigate to the folder containing the file you're replacing. Open the file you're replacing and click on the "Edit" button on the top right. You may or may not need to edit the title or any other information depending on the request. Drag the new file to the bottom of the content tab. Submit, uncheck "use workflow", and publish the file. If the file is being used somewhere on the site, click on "More" and go to relationships. Click on the pages under relationships and publish them to update them with the new file.</p>

            <h2>Editing Text</h2>
            <p>You will often need to edit some text for the AGF website such as an article or a module on the site.</p>
            <p>First find the page you will be working on through Cascade. The search bar at the top right of Cascade can be handy to find the page. Once you're at the page, click on "Edit". Scroll down a bit and you'll see some items. Find the item containing the text you'll be editing and click on "Source Code" (the icon that looks like "&lt;&gt;") to edit the text. Be careful with the formatting if you're not familiar with HTML. Replace or change the text inside (it'll probably be between the "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" for content and "&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;" or something similar for headings). Submit, uncheck "use workflow" and publish the site.

You will mainly be pasting AGF links as SmartLink has been deprecated as of July 2018 so focus on Investor EN/FR and Advisor EN/FR.

            <h2>Getting Familiar with iReport</h2>
            <p>It's very unlikely that you'll have to make a report from scratch, you'll probably be copying an existing report and changing the contents.</p>
            <p>Open up the .jrxml file that you need to work on, you should be on Designer View on default. Designer View is simple to use as you can just simply click on an element and make a quick edit, or select an element from the report inspector on the left to edit. However, as you start adding more detail bands and textfields, the Designer View will get progressively laggier. Changes you make in Designer View can be seen in XML View and vice versa. XML View is very useful when you have a lot of elements and the Designer View is getting difficult to use due to lag. There isn't any lag in XML view if you have a lot of elements, and you can use the search tool (Ctrl + F) which makes it easy to navigate to the specific element you want to change.</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Compiling and Generating Reports</h2>
            <p>When you are finished editing a page, click the "Compile Report" button near the Design View and XML View buttons. If the report is a subreport, then you must also compile the parent reports. Then, head over to Eclipse onto the Java file that is responsible for creating the PDF. Make sure you right click the folder that contained the jrxml files you just edited, and hit "refresh". This ensures that the Java file doesn't run a cached version on the jrxml/jasper files. Then hit run. If everything is properly linked, there should be no errors and a PDF will generated at the specified folder.</p>

            <h2>Detail Bands</h2>
            <p>Detail bands make up each section of the report. Detail bands have a band height that you can adjust when you select a band. Make sure you set the band height so that it has enough room to fit all of its contents. Generally, you would only find three different elements inside detail bands: Textfields, Lines, and Subreports. Each of these elements have a height that you can set. Usually lines and subreports have a height of 1, and textfields have a height of around 10 most of the time. If you need to add one of these elements and there's nothing to copy, then you can open the Palette window by clicking Window>Palette or using the shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+8. From the palette window, drag the element onto the detail band.</p>

            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>Besides height, there are other important properties you should paying attention to. For starters, left and top are used for positioning elements and width is self-explanatory. Keep the elements' heights in mind when positioning them so they don't overlap. However, there a few cases where you want two textfields on top of each other with a print expression attached to both.</p>
            <p>There are a few textfield properties that you should make sure are set. First, make sure all textfields' styles are set to "field(reference)". Set Position Type to "Float" and Stretch Type to "No stretch". Also, make sure "Print Repeated Values", "Remove Line When Blank", "Print When Detail Overflows", "Blank When Null", and "Stretch With Overflow" are all checked. Lastly, make sure Expression Class is on the correct selection. Depending if the Text Field Expression value is a string or boolean, select the appropriate Expression Class from the dropdown.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Expressions, Resources, Parameters, and Fields</h2>
            <p>Now to actually display stuff in textfields, you will need to edit the textfield's "Text Field Expression". You'll most likely be using one or a combination of $R{resource_name}, $F{field_name}, and $P{parameter_name}. Also you can set a condition on an element to display it only when the condition is met using the "Print When Expression". For example, a Print When Expression of "$F{name}.equals('Felix')" would mean the element would only display if the value passed to the "name" field is Felix. </p>
            <p>$R is used for localized strings from a properties file. You will typically use this for things such as labels and headings which don't change. "resource_name" refers to the name of the resource found in the properties file that has the text you want to display. So, if I used $R{report.owner.type.primary} from my i18n_turboApps.properties file, then the textfield would display "Primary Owner" or "Titulaire" depending on the report's locale. This means that when the report's locale is changed to French, all resource strings will also display their French text provided it exists in the French properties file. So when creating any new resources in the properties file, remember to add the French version to the French properties file as well.</p>
            <p>Fields($F) and Parameters($P) are passed from the java files and are both used for variable text such as a client's name. If you're using fields and are working in a subreport, make sure you're referencing the correct Class Object in the subreport's Data Source Expression (you can find this in the subreport's properties window through the parent report). For example, an example of a data source expression is "new net.sf.jasperreports.engine.data.<br/>JRBeanCollectionDataSource(java.util.Collections.singleton<br/>($F{subRptOwnerInfo}))" where $F{subRptOwnerInfo} is the class object referenced through a field. If you're using parameters and are working in a subreport, you have to add a corresponding field to the subreport's parent report. Also in the subreport's properties below Data Source Expression, you have to add the parameter with the corresponding field expression to "Parameters". Both parameters and fields will require a declaration, a getter, and a setter in a java file for that subreport. Their values can be set in the main java file, remember that parameters are set from the subreport's parent's fields.</p>

            <h2>Testing and Comitting to SVN</h2>
            <p>When you have finished making your changes, compiled the report, and the PDF looks good to you, then you have to perform a few other checks and tests to make sure the PDF won't mess up. The first things you should check for are possibly long inputs for fields like names, addresses, etc. where the value can be almost anything. You need to make sure the text correctly moves to the next line without any weird spacing problems (usually due to Stretch Type not being on "No Stretch"). You should also see what happens when a subreport meets a page break and play around with some settings if it doesn't behave how you want it. The next thing you should check is if the report looks fine in French. Double-check that all of the resources are properly translated into French and all of the spacing is fine in the French report. Finally, there should have been some logic given by your project lead or supervisor that you need to implement as Print When Expressions. So, you need to verify that all your print when expressions are working correctly.</p>
            <p>After you've done all the checks and everything looks good, you should commit your changes to SVN. First in Eclipse's project explorer, find your local folder and refresh it (like how you would when you want to generate a report). Then right click it again and go to "Team" and click on "Synchronize With Repository". Then below, under "SVN" right click the folder and click "Commit..". Write a brief commit message and check all the things you want to commit and click "OK". You may also need to let your project lead know that you've submitted changes (I usually walk up to his desk but sometimes I send a skype message).</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Temporarily Fixing the Lag in iReport</h2>
            <p>Before you go fixing the iReport lag, take a screenshot of your classpaths as you're going to need to set them again after the fix. The classpath can be found by going to iReport and clicking Tools>Options>Classpath. Now navigate to your User folder and open the .ireport folder and then the only folder in there which should be whatever version of iReport you have. You should be in C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.ireport\VERSION_NUMBER\ now. Delete everything in the folder and relaunch iReport. Now go back to classpaths in iReport and re-add all the classpaths you had before (this is why we took a screenshot). iReport should work smoothly again, but it will eventually start lagging again and you will have to repeat this process.</p>

            <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
            <p>If you need to build a Web Application for TurboApps, then you may need to implement AddressComplete onto the page. AddressComplete allows the user to look up any address in Canada and it autocompletes the relevant information like address, postal code, city, etc., into textfields you set up.</p>
            <p>First head over to <a href="https://www.canadapost.ca/pca/">the addresscomplete website. </a> You're going to want to create a free trial account so you can implement addresscomplete and test it on your machine. When you create an installation, you will need to input an address where the AddressComplete will be used. For now just add something like localhost:8000/FILENAME.html and hit "Next"</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Adding the Code Snippet</h2>
            <p>Copy the code snippet given to you into your html file. As you can see, the code snippet contains a key unique only to the installation you just made. When you use another installation because your trial ran out and you need to make a new free account, or if the application you built is being pushed into testing server, then you need to replace the key with the new installation's key. Then click "I've pasted and uploaded my code" and then just continue even though it says it can't find the code snippet.</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Dashboard and Installation Settings</h2>
            <p>On the dashboard you can find your all of your installations and you can disable or enable the installations from the dashboard as well. Clicking on your installation will bring you to the general settings page for the installation you clicked on.</p>
            <p> Here you can rename the installation, and add more URLs that would use the HTML page. Add all of the URLs that use the web application, I usually just add the local path to the file as well as localhost (add the localhost one again even though you inputted it earlier). Note that you can include other html pages as long as the textfields are the same. For example, if you have a French version of the page, it should have the same textfield ids and names so you can just add it to the valid URLs and it will work fine.</p>
            <p>If it's your first installation of AddressComplete on an Web Application, then you'll have to go through the initial setup process for the installation. In the advanced settings tab of the installation, turn on setup mode and click "save" at the bottom. Then go back to the advanced settings tab to get and copy the verification code as the code may change after you turn on setup mode.</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Setting Up Field Groups</h2>
            <p>First you should open up Command Prompt and navigate to the folder containing your html file. You'll want to start a localhost server by typing "python -m SimpleHTTPServer". Open up the HTML and you should be prompted to input the setup verification code. Click "No" when it asks if your fields populated correctly and it will then show you all the different sets of fields that are currently grouped together. You'll have to configure these groups as the auto-generated groups are probably not what you had in mind. You'll want to only make one group for each AddressComplete lookup you have on your page, you can get rid of all the other field groups.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Configuring the Fields</h2>
            <p>Configuring the fields is pretty simple, just match the textfield ids with their function. For example, setting a field to "City" means that when you look up an address with AddressComplete, it will automatically fill in the field with the id associated with "city" with the appropriate city. The lookup field should be set to Search Input, it should be the only field that can look up addresses. To verify this, click the three dots beside each field and make sure that the lookup field is the only one that has search checked, everything else should have populate only. Once you are finished configuring your field groups, click "Yes" and setup mode will automatically be turned off.</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Test It Out</h2>
            <p>Before you try it out, you have to add the AddressComplete listener code into your javascript file. Now, you can try it out and make sure that AddressComplete is working on your page. Start typing an address or postal code into the AddressComplete lookup, if everything is working correctly then a bunch of addresses should start populating. Then, select one of those addresses and make sure that your fields are being properly auto-filled. Note that the entire postal code is auto-filled, so if your postal code is split into two fields then you'll have to handle this in the javascript file.</p>
