            <h2>Switching Sites</h2>
            <p>You will probably need to switch sites first before doing anything. This can be done by accessing the dropdown menu at the top left corner of Cascade. You will most likely be in "AGF Files" for most of your tasks.</p>

            <p>Navigate to the folder you are uploading the file or document to. There's probably a similar file in the folder, so copy it and click on "Edit". Edit anything you need to (title, summary, date, etc.) and keep in mind of the naming conventions from the other files in the folder. Drag the file that you're uploading to the bottom of the content tab where it says "Drop a file here". Hit submit, uncheck "use workflow", and publish the file.</p>

            <h2>Replacing Files</h2>
            <p>You may need to replace a PDF, image file, or other files in Cascade.</p>
            <p>Navigate to the folder containing the file you're replacing. Open the file you're replacing and click on the "Edit" button on the top right. You may or may not need to edit the title or any other information depending on the request. Drag the new file to the bottom of the content tab. Submit, uncheck "use workflow", and publish the file. If the file is being used somewhere on the site, click on "More" and go to relationships. Click on the pages under relationships and publish them to update them with the new file.</p>

            <h2>Editing Text</h2>
            <p>You will often need to edit some text for the AGF website such as an article or a module on the site.</p>
            <p>First find the page you will be working on through Cascade. The search bar at the top right of Cascade can be handy to find the page. Once you're at the page, click on "Edit". Scroll down a bit and you'll see some items. Find the item containing the text you'll be editing and click on "Source Code" (the icon that looks like "&lt;&gt;") to edit the text. Be careful with the formatting if you're not familiar with HTML. Replace or change the text inside (it'll probably be between the "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" for content and "&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;" or something similar for headings). Submit, uncheck "use workflow" and publish the site.

You will mainly be pasting AGF links as SmartLink has been deprecated as of July 2018 so focus on Investor EN/FR and Advisor EN/FR.

            <h2>Getting Familiar with iReport</h2>
            <p>It's very unlikely that you'll have to make a report from scratch, you'll probably be copying an existing report and changing the contents.</p>
            <p>Open up the .jrxml file that you need to work on, you should be on Designer View on default. Designer View is simple to use as you can just simply click on an element and make a quick edit, or select an element from the report inspector on the left to edit. However, as you start adding more detail bands and textfields, the Designer View will get progressively laggier. Changes you make in Designer View can be seen in XML View and vice versa. XML View is very useful when you have a lot of elements and the Designer View is getting difficult to use due to lag. There isn't any lag in XML view if you have a lot of elements, and you can use the search tool (Ctrl + F) which makes it easy to navigate to the specific element you want to change.</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Compiling and Generating Reports</h2>
            <p>When you are finished editing a page, click the "Compile Report" button near the Design View and XML View buttons. If the report is a subreport, then you must also compile the parent reports. Then, head over to Eclipse onto the Java file that is responsible for creating the PDF. Make sure you right click the folder that contained the jrxml files you just edited, and hit "refresh". This ensures that the Java file doesn't run a cached version on the jrxml/jasper files. Then hit run. If everything is properly linked, there should be no errors and a PDF will generated at the specified folder.</p>

            <h2>Detail Bands</h2>
            <p>Detail bands make up each section of the report. Detail bands have a band height that you can adjust when you select a band. Make sure you set the band height so that it has enough room to fit all of its contents. Generally, you would only find three different elements inside detail bands: Textfields, Lines, and Subreports. Each of these elements have a height that you can set. Usually lines and subreports have a height of 1, and textfields have a height of around 10 most of the time. If you need to add one of these elements and there's nothing to copy, then you can open the Palette window by clicking Window>Palette or using the shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+8. From the palette window, drag the element onto the detail band.</p>

            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>Besides height, there are other important properties you should paying attention to. For starters, left and top are used for positioning elements and width is self-explanatory. Keep the elements' heights in mind when positioning them so they don't overlap. However, there a few cases where you want two textfields on top of each other with a print expression attached to both.</p>
            <p>There are a few textfield properties that you should make sure are set. First, make sure all textfields' styles are set to "field(reference)". Set Position Type to "Float" and Stretch Type to "No stretch". Also, make sure "Print Repeated Values", "Remove Line When Blank", "Print When Detail Overflows", "Blank When Null", and "Stretch With Overflow" are all checked. Lastly, make sure Expression Class is on the correct selection. Depending if the Text Field Expression value is a string or boolean, select the appropriate Expression Class from the dropdown.</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <h2>Expressions, Resources, Parameters, and Fields</h2>
            <p>Now to actually display stuff in textfields, you will need to edit the textfield's "Text Field Expression". You'll most likely be using one or a combination of $R{resource_name}, $F{field_name}, and $P{parameter_name}. Also you can set a condition on an element to display it only when the condition is met using the "Print When Expression". For example, a Print When Expression of "$F{name}.equals('Felix')" would mean the element would only display if the value passed to the "name" field is Felix. </p>
            <p>$R is used for localized strings from a properties file. You will typically use this for things such as labels and headings which don't change. "resource_name" refers to the name of the resource found in the properties file that has the text you want to display. So, if I used $R{report.owner.type.primary} from my i18n_turboApps.properties file, then the textfield would display "Primary Owner" or "Titulaire" depending on the report's locale. This means that when the report's locale is changed to French, all resource strings will also display their French text provided it exists in the French properties file. So when creating any new resources in the properties file, remember to add the French version to the French properties file as well.</p>
            <p>Fields($F) and Parameters($P) are passed from the java files and are both used for variable text such as a client's name. If you're using fields and are working in a subreport, make sure you're referencing the correct Class Object in the subreport's Data Source Expression (you can find this in the subreport's properties window through the parent report). For example, an example of a data source expression is "new net.sf.jasperreports.engine.data.<br/>JRBeanCollectionDataSource(java.util.Collections.singleton<br/>($F{subRptOwnerInfo}))" where $F{subRptOwnerInfo} is the class object referenced through a field. If you're using parameters and are working in a subreport, you have to add a corresponding field to the subreport's parent report. Also in the subreport's properties below Data Source Expression, you have to add the parameter with the corresponding field expression to "Parameters". Both parameters and fields will require a declaration, a getter, and a setter in a java file for that subreport. Their values can be set in the main java file, remember that parameters are set from the subreport's parent's fields.</p>

            <h2>Testing and Comitting to SVN</h2>
            <p>When you have finished making your changes, compiled the report, and the PDF looks good to you, then you have to perform a few other checks and tests to make sure the PDF won't mess up. The first things you should check for are possibly long inputs for fields like names, addresses, etc. where the value can be almost anything. You need to make sure the text correctly moves to the next line without any weird spacing problems (usually due to Stretch Type not being on "No Stretch"). You should also see what happens when a subreport meets a page break and play around with some settings if it doesn't behave how you want it. The next thing you should check is if the report looks fine in French. Double-check that all of the resources are properly translated into French and all of the spacing is fine in the French report. Finally, there should have been some logic given by your project lead or supervisor that you need to implement as Print When Expressions. So, you need to verify that all your print when expressions are working correctly.</p>
            <p>After you've done all the checks and everything looks good, you should commit your changes to SVN. First in Eclipse's project explorer, find your local folder and refresh it (like how you would when you want to generate a report). Then right click it again and go to "Team" and click on "Synchronize With Repository". Then below, under "SVN" right click the folder and click "Commit..". Write a brief commit message and check all the things you want to commit and click "OK". You may also need to let your project lead know that you've submitted changes (I usually walk up to his desk but sometimes I send a skype message).</p>
